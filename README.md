An Initial Hackintosh EFI for **Lenovo Yoga 720-12IKB**

ENGLISH | [简体中文](https://github.com/williambj1/Hackintosh-EFI-Lenovo-Yoga-720-12IKB/blob/master/Resources/README-zh_CN.md)

This EFI is suitable for [Lenovo Yoga 720-12IKB](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/yoga/700-series/Yoga-720-12/p/88YG7000919)

Supports macOS 10.14.6(18G84) or higher

## About Maintaining This EFI

This is not my daily usage laptop and I seldom use it. I made this EFI just for fun. But I'm afraid I don't have enough time to maintain it. I'm looking forward to someone who owns the same laptop and has Hackintosh skills to take over this EFI and keep maintaining it. If you feel like you're the right person, please open an issue and send an Email to me.

## Known Issues

> I've only done Hackintosh on this laptop for just a few days. There are lots of issues needed to be solved until it can be considered perfect.
